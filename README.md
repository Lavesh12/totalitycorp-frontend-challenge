# E-Commerce Website

A Ecommerce Website made with React.js Framework.

Approach:

My approach revolves around creating a seamless and user-friendly e-commerce experience. Here are the key components:

Product Listing: We display a diverse range of products with images, names, prices, and intuitive "Add to Cart" buttons. Users can easily filter and sort items by category.

Shopping Cart: We've implemented a dynamic cart section where users can see their selected products, adjust quantities, and view the total cost. Additionally, users have the flexibility to increase, decrease, or remove items from the cart.

Real-Time Updates: We provide live updates of the cart's total cost and item count, ensuring users have instant visibility into their shopping activity.

Checkout Process: Our checkout process is streamlined for efficiency. It calculates the total cost of items in the cart and allows users to seamlessly input their shipping information and payment details.

Responsive Design: my website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal functionality on both desktop and mobile devices. I have meticulously tailored the layout to adapt to various screen sizes for an enhanced user experience.
